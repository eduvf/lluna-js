## What’s *Lluna*?

***Lluna*** ([/ˈʎu.nə/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lluna) *lit.* moon) is a personal project involving many subprojects that focus on learning, minimalism and design.

**Lluna lang** is *Lluna*’s programming language, inspired mainly by [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) and [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)).

## Why JS?

However, since it’s JavaScript, you can try this implementation of *Lluna lang* right away in your browser.
